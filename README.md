# Prediction & Matching of Refugee Influx to Job Demands with the Purpose of Providing Settlement and Employment.

Refugees are in need of acceptance into asylum countries to which refugees could settle down, and employment opportunity.

There are multiple countries that provide asylum. If all refugees focus on going to one country, they will quickly exhaust the resources available from that country that was allocated for the refugees.

What we want to do to solve this problem is predict how many refugees will flow into a country and job demand in those countries. Then matching the number of refugees with job demand. If there is a gap, then providing guidance for increasing intake and job opportunities in those countries.


## Objective 

The research aims to provide
* a prediction on refugee influx each yearâ€‹
* a prediction of demand for employment the asylum countries to which refugees can fulfill
